## Background and Aims:
Hepatocellular carcinoma is a malignant tumor characterized by multi-gene dysregulation and significant heterogeneity, posing challenges to its diagnosis and treatment research. Therefore, precise characterization of the oncogenic mechanisms in HCC is urgently needed in clinical practice.

## Approach and Results:
To comprehensively understand the carcinogenic landscape of HCC, we collected samples from 55 HCC patients (SMU cohort) and identified highly malignant hepatocyte subtypes and their molecular characteristics through single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq, samples=44) and bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq, samples =165). Utilizing snRNA-seq data of hepatocyte subtypes, we deconvoluted the cellular composition in the TCGA and Fudan cohorts, uncovering distinct beneficial/detrimental hepatocyte subtypes correlated with patient prognosis. We developed a quantile-based scoring method to integrate 29 human HCC datasets, comprising a total of 4,192 samples. We constructed a universal diagnostic model, termed the Quantile-Distribution Model (QDM), which demonstrated exceptional diagnostic performance across the 4,192 samples (AUC=0.982 for internal datasets, AUC=0.968 for external datasets).

## Conclusions:
In conclusion, our research utilizes snRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data to comprehensively delineate the oncogenic landscape and molecular mechanisms of hepatocytes in HCC. This study has established the largest single-cell resource for hepatocytes in HCC to date, providing a unique framework for future hepatocarcinogenesis research. The HCC diagnostic model we developed is characterized by its simplicity, broad applicability, and high accuracy, setting a paradigm for other cancer research endeavors. Our findings offer valuable insights and effective strategies for the clinical diagnosis and therapeutic management of HCC.
